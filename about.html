              <p> My name is Liam, I just started learning HTML, CSS and Javascript a few weeks ago! I hope to practice making websites
                  using Github and hopefully get good enough at it to have a career in web development. I have been taking the last few
                  years to think about what I would do for a career and suffering from constant existential crises, unable to make any
                  progress in my life and make use of my talents. I am just now on the path to recovery and I may begin blogging to
                  hopefully help others who find themselves in similar situations to myself.
